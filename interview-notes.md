# Interview notes

## Technical interview questions

- What is the difference between == and ===?
- What does status code 403 mean?
- What does status code 301 mean?
- What is a foreign key?
- Why might you need to use foreign keys with AWS IAM?
- What runs on port 80?
- What does the second argument in the reduce method do? What happens if you omit it?

## Pair programming challenge

I had to clone a GitHub repo and follow the instructions. Time allowed was ~15 minutes. Interviewers were more interested in the thought process and approach that I took than the solution (they said it would take ~2 hours to implement a full solution, they just wanted to see how I would begin)

## General interview questions

### Tell us about a project you've worked on that you're particularly proud of

### How did you find the experience of working in that team?

### What were the challenges you faced? How did you overcome them?

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

### Where do you see yourself in 10 years?

### What led you to study xyz at uni, and then subsequently not go into that profession?

### What are some examples of good/bad data visualisation that you've seen?

## General thoughts

- When you don't know the answer to a technical question, don't be afraid to admit it! Try to make an educated guess (and explain your reasoning) if possible
- Verbalise everything during the tech test! Talk your interviewers through the solution you want to implement and why you think it is a good one. (i.e. "We will use the reduce method because it's a good way to sum up all the values in an array")
- Ask your interviewers questions. If you're writing code, ask them if they would like you to write tests.
- When you're answering questions about your experience, try to use examples that relate to things in the job description. i.e. if basic knowledge of git is part of the job description, you could talk about how your team resolved merge conflicts as part of your answer to a question about challenges that you faced
